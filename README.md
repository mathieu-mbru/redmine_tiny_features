# Redmine Tiny Features

This plugin adds some small features we are testing and plan to commit to Redmine core if validated.

Here is a complete list of the features:
* Make it possible to disable **custom field values** per project (only for key/value lists)
* Display a warning message when a user is editing a **closed issue**, and automatically re-open the edited issue
* Hide optional advanced fields in **version** form
* Define a **default project** selected when creating a new issue without being in a specific project
* Add **check-all / uncheck-all shortcuts** to roles filters
* Improve **roles synthesis** by adding missing informations about issues permissions and trackers
* Use or not the select2 plugin
* Improve load time of **users filters** when there are thousands entries and when the select2 plugin is used
* Save **note deletion** in issue journal
* Fix **pasted images** when using Chrome (may be fixed in future Redmine versions according to this issue https://www.redmine.org/issues/36013)
* **Reminders rake task: add max-delay option** to define the maximum number of days after which reminders stop to be sent
* Add **range** custom-field format
* Apply **default value** to existing-issues custom-fields if field is required and not set
* Fix performance problem when filtering issues by custom-values (remove this patch when issue has been addressed in Redmine Core: https://www.redmine.org/issues/37565)
* Add **enabled modules** filter and column in projects list
